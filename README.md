# Static Comms

A website where you can hide your messages in static! Anyone watching with a low enough frame rate, or if the static is simply paused, will be unable to read the message.

For example, if an administrator is watching your screen through GoGuardian (maximum 2 frames per second), they will be unable to see anything but pure random static. On your screen, you can take advantage of the fact that your eyes can discern differences and see boundaries between changing pixels and non-changing pixels to accurately read the hidden word/message.

Messages are autofitted to your screen. Works best with short messages, as those appear largest. Long messages may end up unreadable, depending on how good one is at reading small static.
