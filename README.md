# Static Comms

A website where you can hide your messages in static! Anyone watching with a low enough frame rate, or if the static is simply paused, will be unable to read the message.

## Example

For example, if an administrator is watching your screen through GoGuardian (which is limited to 2 frames per second), they will be unable to see anything but pure random static. However, you on your screen can take advantage of the fact that your eyes can discern differences and see boundaries between changing pixels and non-changing pixels to accurately read the hidden word/message.

It's a little bit of visual magic and I'm pretty proud of it! Use it for whatever you like, but don't get in trouble lol.

## Making it

This is a Siege project.

Messages are autofitted to your screen using a very complicated text engine-like algorithm. Visibility is best with short messages, as those appear largest. Long messages might even be unreadable, depending on how good you are at reading small static messages.

This project was made with vanilla JS Vite and was made by me! AI was used only to figure out HOW to hide messages in static, and did not end up in the codebase at all. In other words, it is all handwritten. I'm not going to lie, the AI was pretty bad at figuring it out so I didn't really use it at all, lol. Whatever.
